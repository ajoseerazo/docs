Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. To use it, send your HTTP requests with an Authorization header that contains the word Basic followed by a space and a base64-encoded stringÂ `username:password`.

```js
'Authorization': 'Basic base64(username:password)'
```
