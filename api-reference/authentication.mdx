# API Key Authentication

Meru APIs use **API key authentication** to secure access to our services. This is a simple and secure method where you include your unique API key in the request headers.

## How It Works

1. **Obtain your API key** from your Meru dashboard or account settings
2. **Include the API key** in the `api-key` header of your HTTP requests
3. **The server validates** your API key and grants access to the requested resources

## Implementation

### Request Header Format

Include your API key in the `api-key` header using this format:

```js
'api-key': '<api-key>'
```
